**Introduction on Package**

1. IC packaging refers to the material that contains a semiconductor device
2. The wafer level chip scale package (WLCSP) is a variant of the flip-chip interconnection technique where all packaging is done at the wafer level. With WLCSPs, the active side of the die is inverted and connected to the printed circuit board (PCB) using solder balls.

(i) QFN (Quad flat no-lead package) is a leadless package that comes in small size and offers moderate heat dissipation in PCBs <-popular

(ii) QFP{Quad flat package) is a surface-mounted integrated circuit package with "gull wing" leads extending from each of the four sides.

3. 
Wire board- Connect chip (Wire bonding is the process of creating electrical interconnections between semiconductors (or other integrated circuits) and silicon chips)
I/O Pads-intermediate structures connecting internal signals from the core of the integrated circuit to the external pins of the chip package
