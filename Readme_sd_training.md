**Introduction on Package**

1. IC packaging refers to the material that contains a semiconductor device
2. The wafer level chip scale package (WLCSP) is a variant of the flip-chip interconnection technique where all packaging is done at the wafer level. With WLCSPs, the active side of the die is inverted and connected to the printed circuit board (PCB) using solder balls

(i) QFN (Quad flat no-lead package) is a leadless package that comes in small size and offers moderate heat dissipation in PCBs <-popular

(ii) QFP{Quad flat package) is a surface-mounted integrated circuit package with "gull wing" leads extending from each of the four sides.

3. Details on architecture:   
(i) Wire board- Connect chip (Wire bonding is the process of creating electrical interconnections between semiconductors (or other integrated circuits) and silicon chips)    
(ii) I/O Pads-Intermediate structures connecting internal signals from the core of the integrated circuit to the external pins of the chip package  
(iii) Core-All fundamental logic of the design (eg: AND gates,pnoms,...) is placed  
(iv) Die-Consists of core, is small semiconductor material specimen on which the fundamental circuit is fabricated  
(v) IP core (intellectual property core)-functional block of logic or data used to make a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or application-specific integrated circuit for a product (Eg of Foundry IPis: PLL (phase lock loop), SRAM,..)  
(vi) Macros-IP which is available in google that can directly use in own design (eg:memories, CBB(custom building block))

**Concept of Software-->Hardware**
1. Synthesis is process of transferring higher level of abstraction (RTL) to implementable lower level of abstraction.  
--> It is the process of transforming RTL to gate-level netlist  
--> High level language -> Low level language 
2. Compiler will translate a high level programming language's source code (Java/C++) into machine level language code  
3. Assembler is a program that takes basic computer instructions and converts them into a pattern of bits that the computer's processor can use to perform its basic operations (in binary form)

Here is the Overview that show by instructor:
